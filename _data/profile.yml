  <p>
    I'm a researcher working on making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reinforcement_learning" target="_blank">Reinforcement Learning (RL)</a> more reliable and ready for real-world use. 
  </p>
  <p>
    While RL has shown impressive results in games and simulations, applying it safely and effectively outside the lab is still a major challenge. My work focuses on building algorithms that help RL systems learn in ways that are not just powerful, but also safe, stable, and aligned with real-world goals and constraints. This includes areas like safety-critical decision-making, learning from imperfect or limited data (offline RL), and developing new ways to guide exploration and generalization. Ultimately, Iâ€™m interested in closing the gap between what RL can do in theory and what it needs to do in practice.
